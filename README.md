## 💡 About

This is a **pet project** built for learning and fun — especially to practice Ruby and working with external APIs.

**Tech stack:**

- Sinatra (minimal Ruby web framework)
- Spotify Web API
- ERB templates (views)
- Vanilla JS for light interactivity
- No database — snapshots stored in local file system per session

---

## ⚠️ Notes

This is a **test version**:

- All data is stored temporarily (per session)
- If you clear cookies, history will be lost
- Not suitable for production or commercial use (yet)

---

## 🛠 Future plans

- Spotify OAuth login
- Friend comparison history
- Notifications when playlists update
- Better mobile support
